This project implements a colour blind filter system for Unity, addressing the lack of built-in accessibility features for colour vision deficiencies (in contrast to Unreal Engine 5).

Features:

.Adds accessibility support for colour blind players.

.Multiple filter types to simulate different colour vision deficiencies.

.Simple in-game access through the pause/options menu.

How to Use:
